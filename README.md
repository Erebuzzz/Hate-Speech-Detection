# Hate Speech Detection

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model and tools for detecting hate speech in text data. The project aims to identify and classify harmful content to promote safer online environments.

## Motivation
Online hate speech has become a significant problem across social media platforms and online forums. This project provides an open-source solution to help detect and mitigate harmful content, supporting content moderation teams, researchers, and developers working on creating safer online spaces.

## Features
- Pre-trained model for hate speech detection
- Text preprocessing pipeline
- Model evaluation metrics and analysis
- API for integration with other applications
- Command-line interface for batch processing
- Visualization tools for analysis

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)
- scikit-learn
- FastAPI
- Docker

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- git

### Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Erebuzzz/Hate-Speech-Detection.git
cd Hate-Speech-Detection

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download pre-trained model (if not included in repo)
python scripts/download_model.py
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Check a single text string
python detect.py --text "Your text here"

# Process a file with multiple texts
python detect.py --file path/to/your/file.txt

# Output to a specific file
python detect.py --file input.txt --output results.csv
```

### Python API
```python
from hate_speech_detector import HateSpeechDetector

# Initialize the detector
detector = HateSpeechDetector()

# Analyze a single text
result = detector.predict("Text to analyze")
print(f"Hate speech probability: {result['probability']}")
print(f"Classification: {result['label']}")

# Batch processing
texts = ["First text", "Second text", "Third text"]
results = detector.predict_batch(texts)
```

### Web API
```bash
# Start the API server
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Model Details

### Dataset
The model was trained on multiple datasets including:
- Dataset 1: Brief description
- Dataset 2: Brief description
- Custom annotated dataset with X entries

### Architecture
The core model uses a fine-tuned transformer architecture based on [model name] with the following modifications:
- Modification 1
- Modification 2

### Performance
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 91.2% |
| Precision | 89.5% |
| Recall | 87.3% |
| F1 Score | 88.4% |

## Visualization

The repository includes visualization tools to help understand model decisions:
- Attention visualization
- Word importance scores
- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves

Example:
```python
from hate_speech_detector import Visualizer

visualizer = Visualizer()
visualizer.attention_map("Your text here")
```

## Limitations
- Current model performs best on English language content
- May have reduced accuracy on certain dialects or slang
- Challenging cases include subtle hate speech, sarcasm, and context-dependent content

## Ethical Considerations
- This tool should be used as part of a broader content moderation strategy, not as the sole decision-maker
- False positives and negatives will occur
- Regular evaluation for bias is recommended
- User privacy should be prioritized in any implementation
